# Ai_morality
Testing/Examining the morality of Ai (chatGPT)

The goal of this project is to create a python program that tests the morality 
and ethical choices of chatGPT, here are the main goals:
-create the API connection with openai
-send the created template
-have a variable inside the template that represents the ethical dilemna
-run a loop that substitutes the template to test a long list of cases
-save the responses, evaluate them then save them someway
-finally: see the responses, percentage of choosing option a or b 
and maybe other analytics
